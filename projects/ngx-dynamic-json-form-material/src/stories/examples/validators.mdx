# Validators (JSON + TS)

Adding `Validators` and `AsyncValidators` are pretty simple.

Just add the `validators` property and that's it.

If you need custom error messages, pass them in the `messages` property or set them global.

```typescript
{
  type: "input",
  key: "anyKey",
  validators: [
    Validators.minLength(10),
    Validators.maxLength(50)
  ],
  messages: {
    minlength: "Add at least 10 characters.",
    maxlength: "Only 50 characters are allowed.",
  },
};
```

You can also pass a pattern:

```typescript
{
  type: "input",
  key: "anyKey",
  validators: [
    Validators.pattern('[0-9]')
  ],
  messages: {
    pattern: "Numbers only",
  },
};
```
