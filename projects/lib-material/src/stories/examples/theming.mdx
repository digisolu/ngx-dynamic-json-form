# Theming and Layouting

After you had successfully installed Angular Material with all its components and Layouts, the ngx-dynamic-json-form component will be in the same design.

Sometimes you want to use a custom CSS-Class or want to add a CSS-Grid. There are 2 ways you can do that:

## Way 1: Adding global classes for the form fields

In many situations you want to add the same classes every time. So you can set the classes using the global configurations.

There you can set a lot of default classes for all components.

More information about global configurations can be found in the [global configuration section](?path=/docs/examples-and-guides-global-configurations--documentation).

## Way 2: Pass classes for the form fields in the JSON

Sometimes you want to pass only one class to one of the elements, so you can use the JSON for it.

All possible classes can be found in the docs of each component.

## What kind of classes are available?

### Default behavior and Auto Classes

You can add classes global or for each component via JSON. The behavior is the following:

**Add global classes will be used if no class was passed via JSON.**

But no worries, we add Auto-Classes for all elements (incl. custom components). All Auto-Classes are starting with `ndf-`.

Most of the Auto-Classes have no CSS-Rules, so you can use and override them directly.

Some examples:

`ndf-mat-input`, `ndf-select`, `ndf-form-field` etc.

You can find them in the generated DOM.

### The form

The `formClassName` can be used to add a class to the form itself. E.g.: for adding CSS-Grid classes.

### Components

Be default, you can add 4 classes:

- `className`: for the material element itself. E.g.: input, select etc.
- `matFormFieldClassName`: for the `mat-form-field` itself.
- `containerClassName`: for the element container. E.g.: To add CSS-Grid Classes like `col-3`
- `formFieldClassName`: for the first element inside the container.

Some components have more classes:

- `rowWrapperClassName`: used for `container` and `multi-row` to wrap a row of form-fields. E.g.: for adding different CSS-Grid classes.
- `rowButtonContainerClassName`: used for `multi-row` to add a class to the buttons at the end of every row. E.g.: for adding different CSS-Grid classes.
- `addButtonClassName`: used for `multi-row` to add a class to the Add-Button.
- `addButtonContainerClassName`: used for `multi-row` to add a class to the Add-Button container.
- `deleteButtonClassName`: used for `multi-row` to add a class to the Delete-Button.
- `deleteButtonContainerClassName`: used for `multi-row` to add a class to the Delete-Button container.
- `prefixClassName`: used for all components wrapped inside a `mat-form-field` to add a class to the prefix.
- `suffixClassName`: used for all components wrapped inside a `mat-form-field` to add a class to the suffix.
